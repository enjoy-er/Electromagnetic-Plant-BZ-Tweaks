Factorio Mod
Small Tweaks for improved collaboration between the BZ-Silica-Legcay Mod for Factorio Version 2.0 and the Space Exploration Integration: Electromagnetic Plant Mod
* Now you can produce Wafer, Solar Cells and Gyros in the Electromagnetic Plant
* No Silicone for the Lubricant Recipe -> For my opionen you need way to much Stone
* You have to enable the more intermediate recipes such a as silicon wafers in the Mod Setting by Silica & Silicon - Legacy to enable those
